# Image upload example in Flutter
This example demonstrates how to handle uploading images in Flutter.

It was only tested through an Android emulator (Pie, API level 28).

## Setting up
I recommend opening the `android` folder in Android Studio first and building the app beforehand ("Make project").

Then, you may open the project in VS Code and hit F5 to run it (make sure that you have the __Flutter__ extension already installed).
